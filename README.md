Thank you for your interests in our work!

The dataset we ultilized for training and testing for NYC is reposited in BaiduYun.

Address: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_lMpaY7bfkkAIPbmJyRCsw  Extraction Codes: 67tu.  

For the contract of SIP dataset, we apologize for its temporal unavailability due to the contract.

You can download this notebook as well as the well-organized dataset for training and testing. The toy example for visualization is in AAAI2020-RiskOracle Respository. 
If you find this work interesting, please find the citation of these two papers (AAAI and TKDE) as below.
Thank you very much.
